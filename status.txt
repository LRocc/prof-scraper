Some questions to consider:

Does your code build properly with "stack build"?
Yes

Are there any parts of the specification you did not implement in part
A?
No

For the 'stretch' part B, which libraries did you use and what kind of
output did you generate?
I tried Using Blaze to generate an html page, but couldn't. The code was left commented inside Report.hs to avoid errors generated when compiling.
Blaze seemed like the easiest library to use in this case, the documentation was hard to read through and there was a lack of example that stopped me from understanding how to proceed.
i then took another approach and tried producing a barchart using Chart and Chart.cairo, couldn't figure it out.

But please feel free to through it as i belive there's some potential for partial credits.
